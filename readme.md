## Rules for Comitting
* Import the C++ and QML code styles **before comitting any code**.
* **Never** force push, your changes, and possibly others, **will be deleted**.
* Only makes changes to the files **you have created**.
* **Do not** push your code if it **does not compile**.
* **Always** make sure you have pulled the latest changes **before pushing**.
* File names should always match the name of the class and **only one class per file**.

## Code Style
* Classes uses pascal case (`ClassName`).
* **All** Variables and methods use dromedary case (`variableName`).
* Brackets are **always** on a new line in C++, but **never** on a new line in QML.
* C++ source files use the .cpp extension and C++ headers use the .h extension.
